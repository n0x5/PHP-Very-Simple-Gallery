Simply drop file into folder

Guide:

1) put all the files in a new folder where you want the gallery accessible from the web

2) create two folders named 'cache' and 'archive'

3) create subdirectories in 'archive' to create the galleries

4) (OPTIONAL) use bookmarklet to add an image and drop it into a dynamically created folder named after
month - year like 'archive/August 2015'. New month folders are created automatically upon usage of the bookmark.
NOTE: You need to have a direct link to an image in the browser for it to work

You also need a phpthumb.Config file for example you can use mine
